Pero ang teorya ng pampublikong mga kalakal ay hindi pinigilan bagkus hindi lamang dahil sa may kamalian sa pangangatuwiran sa moral na ipinahiwatig dito. Kahit na ang utilitaryan sa, pang-ekonomiyang pangangatwiran na nakapaloob sa argumento sa itaas ay malinaw na mali. bilang isang estado teorya ng pampublikong mga kalakal, maaaring mas mahusay na magkaroon ng mga pampublikong mga kalakal kaysa sa hindi magkaroon ng mga ito, bagaman ito ay hindi dapat nakalimutan na walang naunang rason na umiiral ito ay dapat na kinakailangan (kung saan pagkatapos ay tapusin ang pangangatwiran ng mga teorya sa pampublikong kalakal 'dito mismo). Para sa mga ito ay malinaw na posible, at sa kinakailangan ay kilala na maging isang katotohanan, na anarkistang umiiral na kaya lubos na kamuhian ng pagkilos ng estado na mas gusto nila hindi pagkakaroon ng tinatawag na pampublikong mga kalakal sa lahat sa pagkakaroon ng mga ito na ibinigay ng estado.[^16] Sa kahit anumang kaso, kahit na ang agrumento ay nalalabi sa ngayon, upang lumondag mula sa salaysay na ang mga pampublikong mga kalakal ay kanais-nais sa salaysay na dapat sila ay ibigay ng estado ay anumang bagay ngunit hindi kapani-paniwala, dahil ito ay hindi ay nangangahulugan ng pagpili na kung saan ang isa ay sinita. Dahil ang pera o iba pang mga pinagmumulan ay dapat na bawiin mula sa mga posibleng alternatibong mga paggamit upang pondohan ang mga angkop na kanais-nais na mga pampublikong mga kalakal, ang tanging may kaugnayan at naaangkop na tanong ay kung o hindi ang mga alternatibong paggamit na kung saan maaaring ilagay ang pera (yan ay, ang mga pribadong mga kalakal na maaaring makamit ngunit ngayon ay hindi mabibili dahil ang pera ay ginastos sa mga pampublikong mga kalakal sa halip)ay mas mahalaga-mas kagyat-kaysa sa mga pampublikong mga kalakal. At ang sagot sa tanong na ito ay lubos na malinaw. Sa mga alituntunin ng mga pagsusuri ng mga mamimili, gayunpaman lubos na mataas ang antas ng nito, ang halaga ng mga pampublikong mga kalakal ay medyo mas mababa kaysa sa nakikipagkumpitensya sa mga pribadong kalakal dahil kung ang isa ay umalis sa pagpili sa mga mamimili (at hindi pinilit ang isang alternatibo sa kanila), sympre na mas gugustuhin nilang gastosin ang kanilang pera nang iba (kung hindi man ay walang kinakailangang puwersa). Ito ay ang nagpapatunay sa likod ng anumang pag-aalinlangan na ang mga pinagmumulan na ginagamit para sa pagkakaloob ng mga pampublikong kalakal ay nasayang dahil nagbibigay sila ng mga mamimili ng mga kalakal o serbisyo na pinakamainam lamang ang pangalawang pang-kahalagahan. Sa madaling salita, kahit na ang isang akala na ang mga pampublikong kalakal na maaaring malinaw na kilala mula sa mga pribadong kalakal umiiral, at kahit na ito ay ipinagkaloob na ang isang ibinigay na pampublikong kalakal ay maaaring magamit sa, pampublikong mga kalakal ay pa rin makipagkumpitensya sa mga pribadong mga kalakal. At mayroon lamang isang pamamaraan upang matuklasan kung sila ay higit na mapilit at kung gaano kadakila, o kaya ay mutates mutants, kung, at kung anuman, ang kanilang produksyon ay magaganap sa kapinsalaan ng hindi produksyon o pagbawas ng produksyon ng higit pa Ang kagyat na pangangailangan ng mga pribadong kalakal: sa pamamagitan ng pagkakaroon ng lahat ng bagay na ibinigay ng malayang nakikipagtalo sa mga pribadong mga panukala. Samakatuwid, bagkus sa konklusyon ang dumating sa pamamagitan ng mga pampublikong kalakal na mga teorya, ang mga lohikal na pwersa ay isa upang tanggapin ang resulta na tanging ang isang purong sistema ng pamilihan ay maaaring pangalagaan ang pagkamaykatwiran, mula sa pananaw ng mga mamimili, ng isang desisyon upang makabuo ng isang pampublikong kalakal. At sa ilalim lamang ng isang dalisay na kapitalistang kautusan ay maaaring masiguro na ang desisyon tungkol sa kung magkano ang isang mahusay na pampublikong kalakal upang makagawa (kung ito ay dapat na ginawa sa lahat) ay makatuwiran rin.[^17] Hindi dapat bababa sa isang semantikong rebolusyon ng tunay na dimensyon ng Orwell ay kinakailangan na magkaroon ng ibang resulta. Kung ang isang tao ay nais na bigyang kahulugan ang "hindi" ng isang tunay na nangangahulugang "oo," ang "hindi pagbili ng isang bagay" na nangangahulugang ito ay talagang "ginustong higit sa hindi ginagawa ng taong hindi binibili sa halip na hindi pagbili," ng "puwersa "Ang tunay na ibig sabihin ng" kalayaan, "ng" hindi pagkontrata "ay tunay na nangangahulugang" paggawa ng kontrata "at iba pa, maaari bang mapapatunayan ang punto ng teoriya ng mga pampublikong kalakal. [^18] Pero kung paano namin makatitiyak naba talaga sila ang ibig sabihin ng kung ano ang kanilang tila ibig sabihin kapag sinasabi nila kung ano ang kanilang sinasabi, at hindi sa halip ay nangangahulugan ng eksaktong kabaligtaran, o hindi nangangahulugan ng anumang bagay na may tiyak na nilalaman, ngunit lang daing? Hindi maaari ito.Sa katunayan si Murray N. Rothbard ay lubos na tama kapag sinabi nya sa mga pagsusumikap ng mga ideolohiyang pampublikong kalakal upang patunayan ang pagkakaroon ng tinatawag na pagkabigo ng merkado dahil sa walang produksyon o isang dame o dame "kakulangan" ng produksyon ng mga pampublikong kalakal. Siya ay nagsusulat,


[^16]: Tingnan sa argumentong ito na si Rothbard, "Ang Pabula ng Neutral na Pagbubuwis," pahina. 533. Nagkataon lang, ang pagkakaroon ng isang solong anarkista ay nagiging-imbalido din sa lahat ng mga sanggunian sa Pareto na pinakamainam bilang isang pamantayan para sa ekonomikong lehitimong pagkilos ng estado.

[^17]: Talagang pareho ang pangangatuwiran na humahantong sa isa na ayawan ang sosyalistang-istatistika na teorya na itinayo sa diumano'y natatanging katangian ng mga pampublikong kalakal gaya ng nilinaw ng pamantayan ng wala sa pagkakakilanlan, ay nalalapat din kung, sa halip, ang mga naturang kalakal ay tinukoy sa pamamagitan ng paghihiwalay ng hindi sa pangkaraniwang paggamit (tingnan ang tala 6 at 12 sa itaas). Para sa isang bagay, upang makuha ang normatibong salaysay na dapat na ito ay inaalok mula sa pahayag ng katunayan na ang mga kalakal na nagpapahintulot sa hindi pangkaraniwang hindi ibibigay sa libreng merkado sa maraming mga kustomer na maaaring, ang teorya na ito ay haharap sa eksaktong parehong problema ng pag-aatas ng isang makatwirang etika. Higit rito,na ang pangangatwiran ng utilitaryan. Upang maging dahilan, gaya ng ginagawa ng mga teoriya sa pampublikong kalakal, na ang pagsasagawa ng libreng merkado sa pagbubukod ng mga libreng mga sakay mula sa kasiyahan ng mga kalakal na nagpapahintulot sa hindi pangkaraniwang paggamit sa bokyang na mga gastos sa paligid ay nagpapahiwatig ng isang suboptimal na antas ng kapakanang panlipunan at samakatuwid ay nangangailangan ng bayad na pagkilos ng estado may sira sa dalawang kaugnay na bilang. Una, ang gastos ay isang pansariling kategorya at hindi maaaring maging tuloy-tuloy na sinusukat ng anumang tagamasid sa labas. Samakatuwid, upang sabihin na ang mga karagdagang mga libreng mga sakay ay maaaring ipasok nang walang gastos at ganap na hindi ito tatanggapin. Sa katunayan, kung ang mga pansariling gastos sa pagtanggap ng mas maraming mga kustomer nang walang bayad ay talagang bokya, ang pribadong may-ari ng pagawaan ng mahusay na pinag-uusapan 
ay gagawin ito. Kung hindi niya ito ginagawa, ipinapakita nito na ang mga gastos para sa kanya ay hindi bokya. Ang dahilan ay maaaring ang kanyang pananalig na ang paggawa nito ay mabawasan ang kasiyahan na magagamit sa iba pang mga kustomer at sa gayon ay malamang na maubusan ng presyo para sa kanyang produkto; o kaya ito ay maaaring maging ganito ang kanyang ayaw sa mga walang bayad na libreng mga sakay bilang, halimbawa, kapag sinalungat ko ang panukala na ibinalik ko ang aking kulang-sa-puno na buhay na silid sa iba't ibang mga bisita na nag-aanyaya sa sarili para sa hindi pangkaraniwang paggamit. Sa kahit anumang kaso, at dahil sa kahit anumang dahilan ang gastos ay hindi maaaring ipagpalagay na bokya, ito ay nakakalinlang upang magsalita ng isang kabiguan sa merkado kapag ang ilang mga kalakal ay hindi ibinibigay ng libre at walang bayad. Sa kabilang banda, ang pagkalugi sa kapakanan ay talagang hindi maiiwasan kung tinanggap ng isang tao ang rekomendasyon ng mga pampublikong kalakal ng rekomendasyon ng mga teoristang ipagbigay-alam ang mga kalakal na pinapayagan para sa hindi pangkaraniwang paggamit na ibigay nang walang bayad sa pamamagitan ng estado. Liban sa hindi malulutas na gawain ng pagtukoy kung ano ang nagagampanan sa pamantayan na ito, ang estado, na mapagsarili ng boluntaryong mga pagbili ng mga kustomer na tulad nito, ay magiging una sa harap ng walang kapantay na suliranin ng makatwirang pagpapasiya kung gaano kalaki ang ibinibigay ng publiko. Clearly, since even public goods are not free goods but are subject to “crowding” at some level of use, there is no stopping point for the state, because at any level of supply there would still be users who would have to be excluded and who, with a larger supply, could enjoy a free ride. But even if this problem could be solved miraculously, in any case the (necessarily inflated) cost of production and operation of the public goods distributed free of charge for nonrivalrous consumption would have to be paid for by taxes. And this then, i.e., the fact that consumers would have been coerced into enjoying their free rides, again proves beyond any doubt that these public goods, too, are of inferior value from the point of view of consumers to the competing private goods that they now no longer can acquire.

[^18]: The most prominent modern champions of Orwellian double talk are Buchanan and Tullock (see their works cited in note 3 above). They claim that government is founded by a “constitutional contract” in which everyone “conceptually agrees” to submit to the coercive powers of government with the understanding that everyone else is subject to it too. Hence government is only *seemingly* coercive but *really* voluntary. There are several evident objections to this curious argument. First, there is no empirical evidence whatsoever for the contention that any constitution has ever been voluntarily accepted by everyone concerned. Worse, the very idea of all people voluntarily coercing themselves is simply inconceivable, much in the same way as it is inconceivable to deny the law of contradiction. For if the voluntarily accepted coercion is voluntary, then it would have to be possible to revoke one’s subjection to the constitution, and the state would be no more than a voluntarily joined club. If, however, one does not have the “right to ignore the state”—and that one does not have this right is, of course, the characteristic mark of a state as compared to a club—then it would be logically inadmissible to claim that one’s acceptance of state coercion is voluntary. Furthermore, even if all this were possible, the constitutional contact could still not claim to bind anyone except the original signers of the constitution.

    How can Buchanan and Tullock come up with such absurd ideas? By a semantic trick. What was “inconceivable” and “no agreement” in pre-Orwellian talk is for them “conceptually possible” and a “conceptual agreement.” For a most instructive short exercise in this sort of reasoning in leaps and bounds, see James Buchanan, “A Contractarian Perspective on Anarchy,” in idem, *Freedom in Constitutional Contract* (College Station: Texas A&M University Press, 1977). Here we learn (p. l7) that even the acceptance of the 55 mph speed limit is possibly voluntary (Buchanan is not quite sure) since it ultimately rests on all of us conceptually agreeing on the constitution, and that Buchanan is not really a statist, but in truth an anarchist (p. 11).

> [s]uch a view completely economic science asserts that free-market action is *ever* optimal. It is optimal, not from the standpoint of the personal ethical views of an economist, but from the standpoint of free, voluntary actions of all participants and in satisfying the freely expressed needs of the consumers. Government interference, therefore, will necessarily and always move *away* from such an optimum.[^19]

Indeed, the arguments supposedly proving market failures are nothing short of patently absurd. Stripped of their disguise of technical jargon all they prove is this: A market is not perfect, as it is characterized by the nonaggression principle imposed on conditions marked by scarcity, and so certain goods or services that could only be produced and provided if aggression were allowed will not be produced. True enough, but no market theorist would ever dare deny this. Yet, and this is decisive, this “imperfection” of the market can be defended, morally as well as economically, whereas the supposed “perfections” of markets propagated by the public goods theorists cannot.[^20] It is also true that a termination of the state’s current practice of providing public goods would imply some change in the existing social structure and the distribution of wealth. Such a reshuffling would certainly imply hardship for some people. As a matter of fact, this is precisely why there is widespread public resistance to a policy of privatizing state functions, even though in the long run overall social wealth would be enhanced by this very policy. Surely, however, this fact cannot be accepted as a valid argument demonstrating the failure of markets. If a man has been allowed to hit other people on the head and is now not permitted to continue with this practice, he is certainly hurt. But one would hardly accept that as a valid excuse for upholding the old (hitting) rules. He is harmed, but harming him means substituting a social order in which every consumer has an equal right to determine what and how much of anything is produced, for a system in which some consumers have the right to determine in what respect other consumers are not allowed to buy voluntarily what they want with the means justly acquired by them and at their disposal. Certainly, such a substitution would be preferable from the point of view of all consumers as voluntary consumers.

[^20]: This, first of all, should be kept in mind whenever one has to assess the validity of statist-interventionist arguments such as the following, by John Maynard Keynes (“The End of Laissez Faire,” in idem, *Collected Writings*, London: Macmillan, 1972, vol. IX, p. 291):

    > The most important Agenda of the state relates not to those activities which private individuals are already fulfilling but to those functions which fall outside the sphere of the individual, to those decisions which are made by no one if the state does not make them. The important thing for government is not to do things which individuals are doing already and to do them a little better or a little worse: but to do those things which are not done at all.

    This reasoning not only *appears* phony, it truly is.

By force of logical reasoning, one must accept Molinari’s conclusion that for the sake of consumers, all goods and services be provided by markets.[^21] It is not only false that clearly distinguishable categories of goods exist, which would render special amendments to the general thesis of capitalism’s economic superiority necessary; even if they did exist, no special reason could be found why these supposedly special public goods should not also be produced by private enterprises, since they invariably stand in competition with private goods. In fact, in spite of all the propaganda from the public goods theorists, the greater efficiency of markets as compared with the state is increasingly realized with respect to more and more of the alleged public goods. Confronted daily with experience, hardly anyone seriously studying these matters could deny that nowadays markets could produce postal services, railroads, electricity, telephone, education, money, roads and so on more effectively than the state, i.e., more to the liking of consumers. Yet people generally shy away from accepting in one particular sector what logic forces upon them: in the production of security. Hence, for the rest of this chapter I will turn my attention to explaining the superior functioning of a capitalist economy in this particular area—a superiority whose logical case has already been made by now, but which shall be rendered more persuasive once some empirical material is added to the analysis and it is studied as a problem in its own right.[^22]

[^21]: Some libertarian minarchists object that the existence of a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of a common body of law, and hence a government as a monopolistic judge and enforcement agency. (See, for example, John Hospers, *Libertarianism* [Los Angeles: Nash, 1971]; Tibor Machan, *Human Rights and Human Liberties* [Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1975].) Now it is certainly correct that a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of those rules that underlie its operation. But from this it does not follow that this task must be entrusted to a monopolistic agency. In fact, a common language or sign-system is also presupposed by the market; but one would hardly think it convincing to conclude that hence the government must ensure the observance of the rules of language. Like the system of language, then, the rules of market behavior emerge spontaneously and can be enforced by the “invisible hand” of self-interest. Without the observance of common rules of speech, people could not reap the advantages that communication offers, and without the observance of common rules of conduct, people could not enjoy the benefits of the higher productivity of an exchange economy based on the division of labor. In addition, as I indicated above, independent of any government the nonaggression principle underlying the operation of markets can be defended a priori as just. Moreover, as I will argue in the conclusion of this chapter, it is precisely a competitive system of law-administration and law-enforcement that generates the greatest possible pressure to elaborate and enact rules of conduct that incorporate the highest degree of *consensus* conceivable. And of course the very rules that do just this are those that a priori reasoning establishes as the logically necessary presupposition of argumentation and argumentative agreement.

[^22]: Incidentally, the same logic that would force one to accept the idea of the production of security by private business as economically the best solution to the problem of consumer satisfaction also forces one, so far as moral-ideological positions are concerned, to abandon the political theory of classical liberalism and take the small but nevertheless decisive step (from there) to the theory of libertarianism, or private property anarchism. Classical liberalism, with Ludwig von Mises as its foremost representative in the twentieth century, advocates a social system based on the nonaggression principle. And this is also what libertarianism advocates. But classical liberalism then wants to have this principle enforced by a monopolistic agency (the government, the state)—an organization, that is, which is not exclusively dependent on voluntary, contractual support by the consumers of its respective services, but instead has the right to unilaterally determine its own income, i.e., the taxes to be imposed on consumers in order to do its job in the area of security production. Now, however plausible this might sound, it should be clear that it is inconsistent. Either the principle of nonaggression is valid, in which case the state as a privileged monopolist is immoral, or business built on and around aggression—the use of force and of noncontractual means of acquiring resources—is valid, in which case one must toss out the first theory. It is impossible to sustain both contentions and not to be inconsistent unless, of course, one could provide a principle that is more fundamental than both the nonaggression principle and the states’ right to aggressive violence and from which both, with the respective limitations regarding the domains in which they are valid, can be logically derived. However, liberalism never provided any such principle, nor will it ever be able to do so, since, to argue in favor of anything presupposes one’s right to be free of aggression. Given the fact then that the principle of nonaggression cannot be argumentatively contested as morally valid without implicitly acknowledging its validity, by force of logic one is committed to abandoning liberalism and accepting instead its more radical child: libertarianism, the philosophy of pure capitalism, which demands that the production of security be undertaken by private business too.

How would a system of nonmonopolistic, competing producers of security work? It should be clear from the outset that in answering this question one is leaving the realm of purely logical analysis and hence the answers must lack the certainty, the apodictic character of pronouncements on the validity of the public goods theory. The problem faced is precisely analogous to that of asking how a market would solve the problem of hamburger production, especially if up to this point hamburgers had been produced exclusively by the state and hence no one could draw on past experience. Only tentative answers could be formulated. No one could possibly know the exact structure of the hamburger industry—how many competing companies would come into existence, what importance this industry might have compared to others, what the hamburgers would look like, how many different sorts of hamburgers would appear on the market and perhaps disappear again because of a lack of demand, and so on. No one could know all of the circumstances and the changes that would influence the very structure of the hamburger industry—changes in the demands of various consumer groups, changes in technology, changes in the prices of various goods that affect the industry directly or indirectly, and so on. It must be stressed that although similar issues arise concerning the private production of security, this by no means implies that nothing definitive can be said. Assuming certain general conditions of demand for security services (conditions that more or less realistically reflect the world as it presently is) what can and will be said is how different social orders of security production, characterized by different structural constraints under which they have to operate, will respond differently.[^23] Let me first analyze the specifics of monopolistic, state-run security production, for at least in this case one can draw on ample evidence regarding the validity of the conclusions reached and then compare this system with what could be expected if it were replaced by a nonmonopolistic one.

[^23]: On the problem of competitive security production, see Gustave de Molinari, *Production of Security*; Murray N. Rothbard, *Power and Market* (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1977), chap. 1; idem, *For A New Liberty* (New York: Macmillan, 1978), chap. 12; W.C. Woolridge, *Uncle Sam the Monopoly Man* (New Rochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1970), chaps. 5–6; Morris and Linda Tannehill, *The Market for Liberty* (New York: Laissez Faire Books, 1984), part 2.

Even if security is considered to be a public good, in the allocation of scarce resources it must compete with other goods. What is spent on security can no longer be spent on other goods that also might increase consumer satisfaction. Moreover, security is not a single, homogeneous good, but rather consists of numerous components and aspects. There is not only prevention of crime, detection of criminals, and enforcement of the law, but there is also security from robbers, rapists, polluters, natural disasters, and so on. Moreover, security is not produced in a “lump,” but can be supplied in marginal units. In addition, different people attach different importance to security as a whole, and also to different aspects of the whole thing, depending on their personal characteristics, their past experiences with various factors of insecurity, and the time and place in which they happen to live.[^24] Here I address the fundamental economic problem of allocating scarce resources to competing uses, how can the state—an organization not financed exclusively by voluntary contributions and the sales of its products but rather partially or even wholly by taxes—decide how much security to produce, how much of each of its countless aspects, to whom and where to provide how much of what? The answer is that it has no rational way to decide this question. From the point of view of the consumers, its response to their security demands must be considered arbitrary. Do we need one policeman and one judge, or 100,000 of each? Should they be paid $100 a month or $10,000? Should the policemen, however many we might have, spend more time patrolling the streets, chasing robbers, and recovering stolen loot, or spying on participants in victimless crimes such as prostitution, drug use, or smuggling? And should the judges spend more time and energy hearing divorce cases, traffic violations, cases of shoplifting, and murder, or antitrust cases? Clearly, all of these questions must be answered somehow because as long as there is scarcity and we do not live in the Garden of Eden, the time and money spent on one thing cannot be spent on another. The state must answer these questions, too, but whatever it does, it does it without being subject to the profit-and-loss criterion. Hence, its action is arbitrary and necessarily involves countless wasteful misallocations from the consumer’s viewpoint.[^25] Independent to a large degree of consumer wants, the state-employed security producers instead do what they like. They hang around instead of doing anything, and if they do work they prefer doing what is easiest or work where they can wield power rather than serving consumers. Police officers drive around a lot, hassle petty traffic violators, spend huge amounts of money investigating victimless crimes that many people (i.e., nonparticipants) do not like but that few would be willing to spend their money on to fight, as they are not immediately affected by them. Yet with respect to what consumers want most urgently—the prevention of hardcore crime (i.e., crimes with victims), the apprehension and effective punishment of hard-core criminals, the recovery of loot, and the securement of compensation of victims of crimes from the aggressors—the police are notoriously inefficient, in spite of ever higher budget allocations.

[^24]: See Manfred Murck, *Soziologie der Öffentlichen Sicherheit* (Frankfurt: Campus, 1980).

[^25]: To say that the process of resource allocation becomes arbitrary in the absence of the effective functioning of the profit-loss criterion does not mean that the decisions that somehow have to he made are not subject to any kind of constraint and hence are pure whim. They are not, and any such decisions face certain constraints imposed on the decision maker. If, for instance, the allocation of production factors is decided democratically, then it evidently must appeal to the majority. But if a decision is constrained in this way or if it is made in any other way, it is still arbitrary from the point of view of voluntarily buying or not-buying consumers.

    Regarding *democratically* controlled allocations, various deficiencies have become quite evident. As, for example, James Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner write (*The Consequences of Mr. Keynes* [London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 1978], p. 19):

    > Market competition is continuous; at each purchase, a buyer is able to select among competing sellers. Political competition is intermittent; a decision is binding generally for a fixed number of years. Market competition allows several competitors to survive simultaneously…. Political competition leads to an all-or-nothing outcome…. In market competition the buyer can be reasonably certain as to just what it is that he will receive from his purchase. In political competition, the buyer is in effect purchasing the services of an agent, whom he cannot bind…. Moreover, because a politician needs to secure the cooperation of a majority of politicians, the meaning of a vote for a politician is less clean than that of a “vote” for a private firm.

    See also James M. Buchanan, “Individual Choice in Voting and the Market,” in idem, *Fiscal Theory and Political Economy* (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962); for a more general treatment of the problem Buchanan and Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent.*

    What has commonly been overlooked, though—especially by those who try to make a virtue of the fact that a democracy gives equal voting power to everyone, whereas consumer sovereignty allows for unequal “votes”—is the most important deficiency of all: Under a system of consumer sovereignty people might cast unequal votes but, in any case, they exercise control exclusively over things that they acquired through original appropriation or contract and hence are forced to act morally. Under a democracy of production everyone is assumed to have something to say regarding things one did not so acquire; hence, one is permanently invited thereby not only to create legal instability with all its negative effects on the process of capital formation, but, moreover to act immorally. See on this also Ludwig von Mises, *Socialism* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981), chap. 31.

Furthermore, whatever state-employed police or judges happen to do (arbitrary as it must be), they will tend to do poorly because their income is more or less independent of the consumer’s evaluations of their services. Thus one observes police arbitrariness and brutality and the slowness in the judicial process. Moreover, it is remarkable that neither the police nor the judicial system offers consumers anything even faintly resembling a service contract in which it is laid down in unambiguous terms what procedure the consumer can expect to be set in motion in a specific situation. Rather, both operate in a contractual void that over time allows them to change their rules of procedure arbitrarily and that explains the truly ridiculous fact that the settlement of disputes between police and judges on the one hand and private citizens on the other is not assigned to an independent third party, but to another policeman or judge who shares employers with one party—the government—in the dispute.
